# Predictive-Maintenance

# Project Overview
This project focuses on using machine learning to predict failures in air production units of metro compressors. The aim is to minimize downtime and optimize operational efficiency by predicting potential failures before they occur. The model, built with Random Forest, uses historical data to forecast failures, ensuring better maintenance scheduling and reduced production losses.
